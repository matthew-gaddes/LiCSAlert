    """ A function to run the LiCSAlert algorithm on a preprocssed time series.  To run on a time series that is being 
    updated, use LiCSAlert_monitoring_mode.  
    
    Inputs:
        displacement_r2  | dict |  contains the incremental displacements in 'displacement_r2' as row vectors, and a mask ('mask') to conver these into masked arrays
        cumulative_baselines | rank 1 array | cumulative sum of the temporal baselines.  E.g. if acquisitions every 12 days, the cumulative baselines would be 12, 24, 36 etc., 
        acq_dates | list of strings | date of acquisitions in format YYYYMMDD, as a list.  Should be one longer than the number of ifgs as rows in displacement_r2
        n_baseline_end | int | the interferogram number which is the last in the baseline stage.  
        out_folder | path or string | name of folder in which to save ouputs.  
        ICASAR_settings | dict | contains all the settings for the ICASAR algorithm.  See ICASAR for details.  
        run_ICASAR | boolean | If false, the resutls from a previous run of ICASAR are used, if True it is run again (which can be time consuming)
        ICASAR_path | path or string | location of ICASAR package.  
        intermediate_figures | boolean | if True, figures for all time steps in the monitoring phase are created (which is slow).  If False, only the last figure is created.  
        downsample_run | float | data can be downsampled to speed things up
        downsample_plot | float | and a 2nd time for fast plotting.  Note this is applied to the restuls of the first downsampling, so is compound
    Returns:
        out_folder with various items.
