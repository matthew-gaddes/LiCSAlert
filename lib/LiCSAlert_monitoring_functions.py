    Inputs:
        LiCSBAS_bin | string | Path to folder containing LiCSBAS functions.  
        LiCSAlert_bin | string | Path to folder containing LiCSAlert functions.  
        ICASAR_bin | string | Path to folder containing ICASAR functions.  
        LiCSAR_frames_dir | string | path to the folder containing LiCSAR frames.  Needs trailing /
        LiCSAlert_volcs_dir | string | path to the folder containing each volcano.  Needs trailing /
        n_para | int | Sets number of parallel processes used by LiCSBAS.

        2020/11/11 | RR | Add n_para argument
