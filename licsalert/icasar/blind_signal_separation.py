    #######################

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : (p, n) array
        Array with n observations (statistical units) measured on p variables.
    n_comp : int, optional
        Number of components to extract. If None no dimension reduction
        is performed.
    algorithm : {'parallel','deflation'}
        Apply an parallel or deflational FASTICA algorithm.
    whiten: boolean, optional
        If true perform an initial whitening of the data. Do not set to 
        false unless the data is already white, as you will get incorrect 
        results.
        If whiten is true, the data is assumed to have already been
        preprocessed: it should be centered, normed and white.
    fun : String or Function
          The functional form of the G function used in the
          approximation to neg-entropy. Could be either 'logcosh', 'exp', 
          or 'cube'.
          You can also provide your own function but in this case, its 
          derivative should be provided via argument fun_prime
    fun_prime : Empty string ('') or Function
                See fun.
    fun_args : Optional dictionnary
               If empty and if fun='logcosh', fun_args will take value 
               {'alpha' : 1.0}
    maxit : int
            Maximum number of iterations to perform
    tol : float
          A positive scalar giving the tolerance at which the
          un-mixing matrix is considered to have converged
    w_init : (n_comp,n_comp) array
             Initial un-mixing array of dimension (n.comp,n.comp).
             If None (default) then an array of normal r.v.'s is used
     Verbose | Boolean | If Ture, update to terminal 
 
    Results
    -------
    K : (n_comp, p) array
        pre-whitening matrix that projects data onto th first n.comp
        principal components. Returned only if whiten is True
    W : (n_comp, n_comp) array
        estimated un-mixing matrix
        The mixing matrix can be obtained by::
            w = np.asmatrix(W) * K.T
            A = w.T * (w * w.T).I
    S : (n_comp, n) array
        estimated source matrix
    Notes
    -----
    The data matrix X is considered to be a linear combination of
    non-Gaussian (independent) components i.e. X = SA where columns of S
    contain the independent components and A is a linear mixing
    matrix. In short ICA attempts to `un-mix' the data by estimating an
    un-mixing matrix W where S = W K X.
